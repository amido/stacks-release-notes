## [4072] Add GitHub release stage to build for `stacks-java`

Opened: 2021-36-17 13:36
Closed: 2021-03-17 15:03

#### üì≤ What

Added release stage to the pipeline to create a GH release and tag the code with the build number.

#### ü§î Why

The Stacks CLI uses version number tags to determine the version of the project to download. Latest maps to the lastest commit, but it supports downloading from specific tags. In this way we can support deploying older versions of the project.

#### üõ† How

Added a new stage to the pipeline that tags the code and checks it into GitHub. Additionally a release, using the same tag, is created so that people have a reference to use.

Although no artifacts are released on GitHub this is done so that the GitHub Release API can be used (which the CLI supports).

#### üëÄ Evidence

Tests using a branch have been successful in creating the release.
The release has been removed as we only want releases from master.

#### üïµÔ∏è How to test

Notes for QA
