## [3860] Update .NET CQRS Events with permissions

Opened: 2021-58-20 12:58
Closed: 2021-54-21 07:54

#### üì≤ What

Added DOCKER_* env vars to each Azure Function configuration so that the Docker container can be pulled for the function.

#### ü§î Why

The Azure Functions have been configured to run Docker images as their workload. However they did not have the necessary credentials setup to allow them pull from the nonprod or prod ACR.

#### üõ† How

Using the `az` command line tool in the pipeline, the credentials (username and password) for the ACR have been retrieved. Then by using the `az` command again they are being added as configuration items on the function.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/791658/138097065-10f8f6b6-92d3-49cc-8d4f-01d9b29ef11b.png)

#### üëÄ Evidence

Previously the message in Azure was that the function could not connect to the runtime, this was a permissions issue. Now it states that the function cannot be accessed (in the portal) because it is using a Docker image.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/791658/138097243-aaac5dc2-2788-4f6c-a975-bcab8814352f.png)

The function app is now running, before a 404 was received.

Closed: 2021-25-27 09:25

3864 - Remove references of Amido.Stacks.Application.CQRS.Events from CQRS and Events projects

#### üì≤ What

Remove reference to the CQRS Events nuget package. Replace with class librayr within the project.

#### ü§î Why

This is required as it is not possible to rename referenced library class names. The renaming is carried out using the dotnet new templates and will name the domain "Menu" references accordingly.

#### üõ† How

## [3775] DotNet - change the way the Azure function infrastructure is deployed

Opened: 2021-35-11 10:35
Closed: 2021-34-12 10:34

#### üì≤ What

Change the tier for the Azure App Service Plan from Elastic Premium to Standard and only deploy one of these. Both functions will be deployed to the same App Service Plan.

#### ü§î Why

The EP tier was orignally used as it was thought this was what was required for running Containers. However this is not the case.

Running two App Service Plans was a mistake.

The reason for doing this is to reduce costs.

#### üõ† How

In the Terraform template perform the following tasks:

- remove one of the app service plans
- change the SKU to Standard on the remaining App Service Plan and rename it
- Reconfigure both functions to use the single app service plan

#### üëÄ Evidence

All stages of the build have completed as normal

## [3594] Use variable template for stacks-dotnet-cqrs-event

Opened: 2021-21-16 08:21
Closed: 2021-27-16 13:27

üì≤ What

Move the top level variable out of the main pipeline file into a separate file.
AB#3594

ü§î Why

The Stacks CLI currently performs a search and replace on the template file to change the values based on the user input to the CLI. This is brittle because the original value could change and the CLI would not replace the value correctly.

By making this a separate file the CLI is able to build up the file as needed, without the need for any text replacements.

üõ† How

All of the variables are written to the variable template file, azuredevops-vars.yaml. This is included in the main build file, e.g.

variables:
  - template: azuredevops-vars.yml

üëÄ Evidence

The builds are working as before

Closed: 2021-36-31 13:36

#### üì≤ What
1. Updated the app setting base URL to local one as dev ul does not work and make no sense when cqdrs-events template is used to replace the domain name.

## [3377] DevOps: work on AKS background worker build

Opened: 2021-41-26 10:41
Closed: 2021-24-26 11:24

#### üì≤ What

Added build of the AKS Background worker to the pipeline and ensured being deployed into AKS for Dev and Prod

#### ü§î Why

The background worker is a proccess that listens to the Azure Service Bus and processes the messages that are received on the topic for the subscription

#### üõ† How

The `build-netcore.yml` template file is being called a second time to create the Docker image for the Worker process.
The image is then being pushed to the container registry (both Dev and Prod based on the stage).

The manifest file for Kubernetes has been modified so that it will deploy the API as well as the background worker process. This is now being saved as a build artefact so that it can be viewed if so required.

#### üëÄ Evidence

Two pods are now being deployed into Kubernetes

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/791658/130948720-e7b40ffc-225a-4b22-9271-6cf019e1b28e.png)

As the background worker is a process that does not need to be accessed it does not have a service or an ingress associated with it.

The manifest file does contain a ConfigMap for the worker process that accesses the secret for the ServiceBus Connection String. The `appsettings.json` for the app is also set here.


#### ‚úÖ Acceptance criteria Checklist

- [ ] Documentation has been updated to reflect the changes?

## [3301] Update pipeline to create GitHub release artifact

Opened: 2021-13-24 10:13
Closed: 2021-25-24 13:25

#### üì≤ What

Added steps to the Build stage to create the Nuget packages for the templates and upload them as a build artefact
Added new stage, Release, to create a new GitHub release for the project and upload the Nuget package to Nuget

#### ü§î Why

So that people are able to add additional code to an existing project the templates need to be built as a Nuget package and uploaded to Nuget
The packages are also added as part of a GitHub release so that the Stacks CLI can download them when preparing a new project on a users machine

#### üõ† How

Added some new steps to the build:
- create the file structure for the `nuget pack` command to run
- use an existing template to create the nuget package with the appropriate version number
- upload the template package as a pipeline artefact

Added a new Release stage at the end of the pipeline. This is only run from master and can be controlled using a variable
- download package as an artefact from the pipeline
- tag the code with the version number so it is possible to clone the code at the point at which the package was created
- create a new GitHub release on the repository
- Upload the nuget package to Nuget using an existing template

#### üëÄ Evidence

The package is uploaded as an artefact to Azure DevOps

## Test/3111 functional tests - Indicative comment for the steps once sub/pub is used in the real project

Closed: 2021-41-28 10:41

#### üì≤ What
Added an indicative step as commented step to test the action of the events. No actual step is added for functional tests.

#### ü§î Why
This repo introduces the event pattern. As a purpose of the functional tests is to test the business behaviour and domain-specific event and its consequence (action). As this action is not included, there is no need to add functional tests in this repo.

The commented step indicates the reference for a real project where the event for the domain and its action are implemented and these should be covered in the functional tests.
